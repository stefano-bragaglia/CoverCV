\makelettertitle

As a follow up to our email exchange, please find enclosed my CV, my list of  publications and my one\--page summary to consider for roles in \emph{Google}'s \emph{Software Engineer Team}.

As you can see, I possess some expertise ranging from the \emph{Knowledge Representation}, to the \emph{Production Rules Systems}, passing by the \emph{Statistical Relational Learning} and, of course, some experience as a \emph{Software Engineer}. 
I know many languages and tools, but \emph{Java} and its ecosystem are the platform on which I am more proficient. 
I like the team work and I find very rewarding to coach groups of people and to lead them towards the goal, as I currently do with my students.

You can see the quality and attention to details with whom I am used to work by looking at the care that I put in realising my one\--page profile summary. 
I truly believe that my competence and enthusiasm could be a valuable resource for your Company, not to mention my pleasure and honour to work for such a big and committed name in the IT industry.

I thank you in advance for your time and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
