  abstract = {Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning are families of techniques that are exploited in Machine Learning applications to perform advanced tasks in several domains. Every day the size and complexity of such problems increases and advanced, expressive and efficient tools are needed to successfully solve them. The literature proposes several algorithms to cope with these problems, each of them with its own quirks and perks. Among various solutions, Logic Programming with Annotated Disjunctions (LPAD) is one of the more attractive formalisms, thanks to the expressiveness and readability of its language. Unfortunately, its most advanced implementations are lacking efficient features and techniques that have been introduced for other formalisms, such as ProbLog. In this work, after introducing LPADs and an inference algorithm for computing the probability of a query, we investigate four different approximated algorithms, inspired by similar work done in ProbLog. In particular, we present each algorithm and we evaluate its performances on real and artificial datasets. The results show that our approaches have performances that are usually in line with ProbLog. The Monte Carlo algorithm, however, has performances that are better than the exact approach in terms of both the maximum size of the problems and the execution time, with a neglectable loss in the accuracy of the result.},

  abstract={In 1986 Kowalski and Sergot proposed a logic-based formalism named Event Calculus (EC), for specifying in a declarative manner how the happening of events affects some representation (the state) of the world. Since its introduction, EC has been recognized for being an excellent framework to reason about time and events. Recently, with the advent of complex software systems decomposed into sets of autonomous, heterogeneous distributed entities, EC has drawn attention as a viable solution for monitoring them, where monitoring means to represent their state and how events dynamically affect such state.
In this work we present the fundamentals of a reactive and logic-based version of EC, named REC, for monitoring declarative properties, while maintaining a solid formal background. We present some results about its formal as well as practical aspects, and discuss how REC has been applied to a variety of application domains, namely BPM, SOC, CGs and MAS. We also highlight some key issues required by the monitoring task, and finally discuss how REC overcomes such issues.},

  abstract = {Rules are definitely among the main kinds of knowledge representation in Artificial Intelligence. In recent years, there has been much discussion about production rules and logic programming to understand whether the two paradigms could be joined or, alternatively, which was the better. Conversely, the idea to program a production system with logic without actually relying on logic programming was proposed.
In this paper we present a software component that implements a typical logic formalism, the Event Calculus within a production rules system. This component allows to perform deductive reasoning tasks (temporal projection or prediction, such as monitoring) and thanks to some technical choices, it proves to be quite efficient. In addition, thanks to its strong modular nature, it can adapt to the domain’s requirements and complement other forms of reasoning at the same time.
We also present some preliminary results on tests that we have conducted to show that our system based on a Java rules engine is almost as efficient as an equivalent logic program running on the fastest C++ Prolog interpreter. Furthermore we show how our framework can be used to effectively observe the evolving state of our use case – a Service Oriented Architecture server – in a way that qualifies as Complex Event Processing.},

   abstract = {The standardization and broad adoption of Service Oriented Architectures, Web Services, and Cloud Computing is raising the complexity of ICT systems. Hence, assuring correct system behavior with regard to established design and business constraints is of the utmost importance. Run-time monitoring, where the outcomes of an observed system are continuously checked against what is expected of it, is one possible approach to providing the required oversight. In this paper, we discuss this notion of rule expectations, their violation and/or fulfillment, and use these concepts to define the concept of an Event-Condition-Expectation (ECE-) rule, a variation of the traditional Event-Condition-Action rule pattern. To demonstrate these concepts, we present extensions to the syntax used by the production rule engine, Drools, and describe their use in a medical case study. The clinical decision support system being developed monitors rule evaluations and expectations, detects constraint violations and is able to take recovery/ compensation actions as appropriate.},

Research areas like Multi Agent Systems, Business Process, and Legal/Normative systems, have proposed different characterizations of the same problem, named as the conformance problem. Most of the available systems, however, provide only simple yes/no answers to the conformance issue. In this paper we introduce the idea of a gradual conformance, expressed in fuzzy terms. To this end, we present a system based on a fuzzy extension of Drools, and exploit it to perform conformance tests. In particular, we consider two aspects: the first related to fuzzy ontological aspects, and the second about fuzzy time-related aspects. Moreover, we discuss how to conjugate the fuzzy contributions from these aspects to get a single, fuzzy score representing a conformance degree.},

Such integration may be achieved by following two complementary approaches: loose integration vs. tight integration. Loosely integrated hybrid systems couple existing tools, so they have to handle mutual interactions and keep their models aligned. Tightly-coupled hybrid systems, instead, are based on a unified model supporting both reasoning styles. In this paper we present a basic implementation of a fuzzy tableau algorithm for description logics by means of rules. It is a step towards tight integration because it requires only one rule engine while preserving the semantics of both reasoning styles. In particular, the adoption of a fuzzy tableau in a fuzzy rule engine allowed us to extend the expressiveness of the latter while handling description logics reasoning coherently.},

In this paper we adapt to LPAD the approaches for approximate inference that have been developed for ProbLog, namely k -best and Monte Carlo. k -Best finds a lower bound of the probability of a query by identifying the k most probable explanations while Monte Carlo estimates the probability by smartly sampling the space of programs. The two techniques have been implemented in the cplint suite and have been tested on real and artificial datasets representing graphs. The results show that both algorithms are able to solve larger problems often in less time than the exact algorithm.},
